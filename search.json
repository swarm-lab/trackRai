Preparing a training dataset","text":"final step process generate training dataset . create composite images set number instances printed background image, random locations orientations within boundary mask loaded/created earlier. also create bounding boxes objects YOLO needs learn objects look like.  First, set “Number instances” included composite images. number instances high enough result lot random arrangements overlaps YOLO can generalize better situations objects touch overlap. can also set “Mask buffer” zone ensure printed objects overlap much mask boundaries (.e., stick observation area). Next, can “Add random image noise” composite images order increase generalizability YOLO training. can also “Add random gain” “Add random bias” change contrast luminosity composite images even generalizability. check effect parameter resulting composite images, can click “Generate test composite” button generate one sample composite images. satisfied results, can set number images used training, validating, testing YOLO model train separate app. recommended breakdown reserve 70% images training, 15% validating testing, respectively. can generate training dataset clicking “Generate YOLO dataset” button. bring file manager can select location like dataset saved (folder named “YOLO” created location). process terminates, done can close app. next step training YOLO model using dataset just created. Note: generating training dataset, can also ask app create reframed video ticking tick box bottom sidebar. prepare video file everything outside mask removed dimensions image set optimize processing done YOLO training tracking phases. completely optional add processing time, performing training tracking reframed video can twice fast original video, depending number objects track. video used throughout tutorial provided Sridhar, V.
