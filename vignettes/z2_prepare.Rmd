`trackRai` provides four apps to: 

1. generate a training dataset suitable for training a YOLO model (this tutorial);
2. [train a YOLO model using that dataset](https://swarm-lab.github.io/trackRai/articles/z3_train.html);
3. [use the trained model to track objects in a video](https://swarm-lab.github.io/trackRai/articles/z4_track.html);
4. [visualize the results of the tracking](https://swarm-lab.github.io/trackRai/articles/z5_visualize.html). 

In this tutorial, we will discuss how to use the first app to automatically 
generate a dataset that you can then use to train a YOLO model. The idea here is
to use traditional computer vision techniques to isolate single instances of the 
objects that you would like to track, as well as the background over which these 
objects are moving. We will then use them to create composite images with random
arrangements of an arbitrary large number of these isolated objects. Using that 
approach, we can generate automatically a large number of training images for 
YOLO, without requiring any manual labelling.  

**Note:** this approach only works well if the background of the video is stable, 
with, ideally, no camera movement and no lighting variations. Good tracking 
results are not guaranteed otherwise.
